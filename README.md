# Spotify Music Analytics ‚Äì Tableau Project

## üéØ What I Built
As an extension task during my justIT Data Skills Bootcamp, I created an interactive dashboard in Tableau to analyze the audio features of popular songs on Spotify. The dashboard explores relationships between features like 'danceability', 'energy', and 'valence' (positivity) across different genres and artists.

## üí° Key Things I Learnt
- **Data Exploration**: I learned to work with a dataset containing multiple numerical metrics, identifying interesting relationships to visualize.
- **Advanced Charting**: I used scatter plots to investigate correlations between different audio features and bar charts to compare average feature values across genres.
- **Dashboard Interactivity**: I implemented filters for `genre` and `artist`, allowing users to dynamically explore the music profile of their choice.
- **Data Storytelling**: I designed the dashboard to tell a story about what makes songs sound the way they do, translating abstract numbers into understandable musical characteristics.
- **Self-Directed Learning**: As an extension task, this project taught me to define my own analytical questions and build a dashboard to answer them.

## üîç Top Insights
| Insight | Evidence | Musical Takeaway |
|---|---|---|
| High energy doesn't always mean happy | The scatter plot shows that many high-energy tracks have a low valence (positivity), and vice-versa. | A song can be fast-paced and loud without being "happy," which is common in genres like rock or certain types of electronic music. |
| Genres have distinct audio fingerprints | Filtering the dashboard by genre reveals unique profiles. For example, 'Acoustic' tracks consistently have high `acousticness` and low `energy`. | The audio features provided by Spotify are effective at numerically distinguishing between different styles of music. |
| Danceability is a key metric for Pop | When filtering for 'Pop' or 'Dance Pop', the `danceability` metric is consistently higher than in most other genres. | This confirms that for a song to be a pop hit, making it easy to dance to is a critical component of its structure. |

## üöÄ How to Explore
1.  **Click the link above to open the live dashboard on Tableau Public.**
2.  Use the filters to select a genre or artist you are interested in.
3.  Hover over data points on the charts to see detailed information about specific tracks.

## üìÅ Project Files
- `Extension_Task_SpotifyFeatures.xlsx` - The raw Spotify dataset used for the analysis.
- `SPOTIFY DASHBOARDS.twbx` - The packaged Tableau workbook file.
- `screenshots/` - The two PNG images referenced above.
- `README.md` - This guide.

## üéì Part of My Bootcamp Journey

## ü§î If I Had More Time
- I would blend this data with another dataset containing track popularity or chart performance to see which audio features correlate with commercial success.
- I would use Tableau's clustering feature to automatically group songs into new, data-driven genres based on their audio features alone.
